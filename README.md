Laparoscopic surgery has become a key component in diagnosing and treating certain infertility issues. It's a minimally invasive procedure that allows doctors to view and sometimes treat conditions affecting a woman's reproductive organs—such as the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes—with just a few small incisions.

Using a camera called a laparoscope, fertility specialists can look inside the abdomen to identify problems like endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, pelvic adhesions, or blocked fallopian tubes—issues that often go undetected with basic imaging like ultrasounds. In many cases, these problems are treated during the same procedure, making it both diagnostic and therapeutic.

This form of surgery not only improves diagnosis accuracy but also offers faster recovery, minimal scarring, and fewer complications compared to traditional open surgery. For women who are struggling to conceive, identifying and treating these hidden conditions can significantly improve the chances of natural pregnancy or boost the success of IVF.
